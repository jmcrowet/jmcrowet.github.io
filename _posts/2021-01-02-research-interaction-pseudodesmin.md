<p>Pseudodesmine A is a cyclic lipodepsipeptide which exhibits moderate antibacterial activity and whose structure has 
been resolved by X-rays and NMR. This peptide, monomeric in acetonitrile, keeps the same structure in chloroform but 
assembles into a supramolecular complex. Comparison of the NMR data collected in the two solvents gave indications of 
the intermolecular contacts that occur but a structure of the agregate could not be defined. To study this assembly, 
dimerization simulations by molecular dynamics were carried out. Dimeric structures with linear, perpendicular and side 
by side configurations were observed. Those dimers were characterized by 2 to 4 hydrogen bonds. By combining linear and 
lateral dimers, it was possible to reconstruct filaments whose properties correspond to the values measured in NMR with 
respect to the width, the length, the orientation and the interaction of the peptides within the oligomers. This study 
was published in J Phys Chem B in 2019 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.040" class="text-success"
