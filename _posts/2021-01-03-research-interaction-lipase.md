<p><i>Thermomyces lanuginosa</i> lipase has been widely studied in industrial and biotechnological research because of its potential for the transformation 
of triacylglycerol. We have studied the structure of this lipase by molecular dynamics in the presence of an aggregate of triglycerides. The simulations 
confirmed the high plasticity of the loop covering the active site (called LID) and 
showed that the lipid molecules also bind to a secondary pocket next to the LID. Together, these results strongly suggest that the LID plays a role in 
the anchoring of the protein to the aggregate. The simulations also revealed the existence of a polar channel that connects the active site to the 
solvent. This channel could regulate the water content of the active site. This study was published in the Biophysical Journal in 2009 (DOI:
