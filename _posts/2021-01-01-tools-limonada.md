<p>The size and complexity of lipid systems simulated by molecular dynamics is continuously growing. Knowing that there could 
be over 100,000 lipid species and that biological membranes can be composed by hundreds of different lipids whose proportion 
are organism and organelle specific, LIMONADA has been built as an open web database to provide model compositions representative 
of biological membranes, along with the description of lipids, topologies and force fields mandatory for their molecular dynamics 
simulations.</p>
