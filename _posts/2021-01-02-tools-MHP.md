<p>MHP have been developped by Robert Brasseur in 1991 (PubMed ID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1714906/" 
class="text-success" target="_blank">1714906</a>) and allows to represent hydrophobic properties of molecules. 
MHP decrease exponentially with distance and are computed from transfert energy associated to seven atoms types. 
MHP are presented as isopotential surfaces. Have a look to the paper for a more detailed description.</p>
<p>During my PhD at the laboratory of Robert Brasseur, I wrote a plugin for Pymol which calculates MHP from 3D files in 
PDB format. It has notably be used to follow the trajectory of CADY peptide (DOI: <a

Laurence Lins also studied protein surfaces throuh MHP in 2003 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1110/ps.0304803"
