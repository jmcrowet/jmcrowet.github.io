Fusion peptides are building blocks of several enveloped viruses that allow fusion between the host membrane and the viral membrane. 
It is generally suggested that these peptides can promote early fusion steps by inducing membrane curvature and that they occur as 
tilted Î±-helices in membranes. Although this property has been the subject of several experimental and <i>in silico</i> studies, extensive 
sampling of the peptide-membrane interaction has not yet been performed. In this study, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics 
simulations in which the lipid bilayer self-assembles around the peptide. The simulations indicate that the SIV fusion peptide can take 
on two different orientations in a model lipid bilayer, a major population which adopts 
a tilted interfacial orientation and a minor population which is perpendicular to the bilayer. The simulations also indicate that for 
the SIV mutant which does not induce fusion <i>in vitro</i>, the tilt is abolished. This study was published in Journal of Physical Chemistry 
B in 2012 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp3027385" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.1021/jp3027385</a>).</p>
