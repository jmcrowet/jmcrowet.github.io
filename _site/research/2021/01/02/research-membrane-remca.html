<p>Remorin is a plant specific protein that is involved in viral resistance and recognized as a marker for lipid rafts in plants. 
Analysis of the sequence of this protein has identified a C-terminal membrane domain (RemCA) which has been shown to be essential 
and sufficient for the binding of the protein to the plasma membrane. This domain consists of an amphipathic Î± helix and an 
unstructured hydrophobic segment, the structures and behavior of which have been studied experimentally and by modeling, in 
particular in relation to the interaction with <abbr title="Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate">PIP4P</abbr>. Amphipathy reducing mutations abolished 
the localization of remorin at the plasma membrane and its function in restricting the movement of potato virus X. This study 
resulted in two publications in Plant Physiology in 2012 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.200519" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.1104/pp.112.200519</a>) and Elife in 2017 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26404" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.7554/eLife.26404</a>).</p>
