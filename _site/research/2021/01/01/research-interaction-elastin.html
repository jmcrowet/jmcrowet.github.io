<p>Peptides exhibiting this motif were searched for in the UniProtKB database. The results show that elastin peptides have particular 
characteristics. Indeed, in elastin, several motifs are often found in the same sequence and mostly in tandem. 
In addition, the variable residues of the motif are enriched in hydrophobic residues and some human elastin peptides are unique among the 
peptides found (i.e. AGVPGFGVG). The conformational characterization was then carried out by molecular dynamics on 4 human 
nonapeptides. The results show that the peptides are mainly in a “random coil” conformation and with a type II β turn. These β turns 
are formed at the level of the PG residues. Other types of β turns can also be formed in 
smaller amounts at other positions in the peptide sequence. There is good agreement between the spectcroscopic studies (CD and Raman) which 
were also carried out during this study and the simulations. CD spectra were notably calculated from MD simulations and 
compared to experimental spectra. This conformation could be relevant for the observed bioactivity of these peptides, in particular tumor 
progression, and their potential interaction with the ribosomal protein SA. This study has been published in the Biophysical 
Journal in 2020 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.04.019" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.1016/j.bpj.2020.04.019</a>).</p>
