<p>The detailed structure of plasmodesmas, which correspond to intercellular connections between cells of plants, 
is not yet fully understood. Within these structures, the transmembrane region of MCTPs could bind to the membrane 
of the endoplasmic reticulum while several C2 domains could interact with the plasma membrane. The objective of 
the work was to predict the membrane interaction capacities of these C2 domains. Sequence analysis was used to 
delineate the domains which were then modeled by homology modelling and then their membrane interaction was simulated. The 
results of these simulations allowed us to predict their modes of interaction and to underline the importance of 
electrostatic interactions with the polar heads of lipids. A specific interaction between the C2D domain and 
PI4.5P has been demonstrated. This study was published in EMBO Reports in 2019 (DOI:
