      <img class="illustration" src="http://localhost:4000/research/images/lipase.png"/>
      <p><i>Thermomyces lanuginosa</i> lipase has been widely studied in industrial and biotechnological research because of its potential for the transformation 
of triacylglycerol. We have studied the structure of this lipase by molecular dynamics in the presence of an aggregate of triglycerides. The simulations 
confirmed the high plasticity of the loop covering the active site (called LID) and 
showed that the lipid molecules also bind to a secondary pocket next to the LID. Together, these results strongly suggest that the LID plays a role in 
the anchoring of the protein to the aggregate. The simulations also revealed the existence of a polar channel that connects the active site to the 
solvent. This channel could regulate the water content of the active site. This study was published in the Biophysical Journal in 2009 (DOI:

      <h2 class="research_title">Study of Pseudodesmin peptide - peptide interactions</h2>
      <img class="illustration" src="http://localhost:4000/research/images/pseudodesmin.jpg"/>
      <p>Pseudodesmine A is a cyclic lipodepsipeptide which exhibits moderate antibacterial activity and whose structure has 
been resolved by X-rays and NMR. This peptide, monomeric in acetonitrile, keeps the same structure in chloroform but 
assembles into a supramolecular complex. Comparison of the NMR data collected in the two solvents gave indications of 
the intermolecular contacts that occur but a structure of the agregate could not be defined. To study this assembly, 
dimerization simulations by molecular dynamics were carried out. Dimeric structures with linear, perpendicular and side 
by side configurations were observed. Those dimers were characterized by 2 to 4 hydrogen bonds. By combining linear and 
lateral dimers, it was possible to reconstruct filaments whose properties correspond to the values measured in NMR with 
respect to the width, the length, the orientation and the interaction of the peptides within the oligomers. This study 
was published in J Phys Chem B in 2019 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.040" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.040</a>).</p>

      <img class="illustration" src="http://localhost:4000/research/images/elastin.png"/>
      <p>Peptides exhibiting this motif were searched for in the UniProtKB database. The results show that elastin peptides have particular 
characteristics. Indeed, in elastin, several motifs are often found in the same sequence and mostly in tandem. 
In addition, the variable residues of the motif are enriched in hydrophobic residues and some human elastin peptides are unique among the 
peptides found (i.e. AGVPGFGVG). The conformational characterization was then carried out by molecular dynamics on 4 human 
nonapeptides. The results show that the peptides are mainly in a “random coil” conformation and with a type II β turn. These β turns 
are formed at the level of the PG residues. Other types of β turns can also be formed in 
smaller amounts at other positions in the peptide sequence. There is good agreement between the spectcroscopic studies (CD and Raman) which 
were also carried out during this study and the simulations. CD spectra were notably calculated from MD simulations and 
compared to experimental spectra. This conformation could be relevant for the observed bioactivity of these peptides, in particular tumor 
progression, and their potential interaction with the ribosomal protein SA. This study has been published in the Biophysical 
Journal in 2020 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.04.019" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.1016/j.bpj.2020.04.019</a>).</p>

<div class="border rounded-bottom bg-white p-2">
  <p>As membranes constitute the interface between living cells, organites and their environment, membrane interactions
  are of paramount importance in many biological processes as well as for biotechnological applications. Molecular
  dynamics gives the atomistic details of these processes and is very useful to study the evolution of bio-molecule and
  membrane structures following their interactions.</p>

      <img class="illustration" src="http://localhost:4000/research/images/siv.png"/>
      <p>
Fusion peptides are building blocks of several enveloped viruses that allow fusion between the host membrane and the viral membrane. 
It is generally suggested that these peptides can promote early fusion steps by inducing membrane curvature and that they occur as 
tilted α-helices in membranes. Although this property has been the subject of several experimental and <i>in silico</i> studies, extensive 
sampling of the peptide-membrane interaction has not yet been performed. In this study, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics 
simulations in which the lipid bilayer self-assembles around the peptide. The simulations indicate that the SIV fusion peptide can take 
on two different orientations in a model lipid bilayer, a major population which adopts 
a tilted interfacial orientation and a minor population which is perpendicular to the bilayer. The simulations also indicate that for 
the SIV mutant which does not induce fusion <i>in vitro</i>, the tilt is abolished. This study was published in Journal of Physical Chemistry 
B in 2012 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp3027385" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.1021/jp3027385</a>).</p>

      <h2 class="research_title">The C-terminal domain of remorin</h2>
      <img class="illustration" src="http://localhost:4000/research/images/remca.jpg"/>
      <p>Remorin is a plant specific protein that is involved in viral resistance and recognized as a marker for lipid rafts in plants. 
Analysis of the sequence of this protein has identified a C-terminal membrane domain (RemCA) which has been shown to be essential 
and sufficient for the binding of the protein to the plasma membrane. This domain consists of an amphipathic α helix and an 
unstructured hydrophobic segment, the structures and behavior of which have been studied experimentally and by modeling, in 
particular in relation to the interaction with <abbr title="Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate">PIP4P</abbr>. Amphipathy reducing mutations abolished 
the localization of remorin at the plasma membrane and its function in restricting the movement of potato virus X. This study 
resulted in two publications in Plant Physiology in 2012 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.200519" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.1104/pp.112.200519</a>) and Elife in 2017 (DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26404" class="text-success" target="_blank">10.7554/eLife.26404</a>).</p>

      <img class="illustration" src="http://localhost:4000/research/images/mctp.png"/>
      <p>The detailed structure of plasmodesmas, which correspond to intercellular connections between cells of plants, 
is not yet fully understood. Within these structures, the transmembrane region of MCTPs could bind to the membrane 
of the endoplasmic reticulum while several C2 domains could interact with the plasma membrane. The objective of 
the work was to predict the membrane interaction capacities of these C2 domains. Sequence analysis was used to 
delineate the domains which were then modeled by homology modelling and then their membrane interaction was simulated. The 
results of these simulations allowed us to predict their modes of interaction and to underline the importance of 
electrostatic interactions with the polar heads of lipids. A specific interaction between the C2D domain and 
PI4.5P has been demonstrated. This study was published in EMBO Reports in 2019 (DOI:
